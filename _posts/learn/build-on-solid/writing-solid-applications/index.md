This tutorial assumes you are familiar with modern Javascript and its ecosystem (e.g. you know what
npm is), know how to write regular Web Apps, and are interested in building one that stores data to
a [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) Pod.

It does not assume prior knowledge of
Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data, RDF, or knowing what those terms mean in the first place.
