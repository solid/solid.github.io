This week there are no proposals ready for editorial review. 

### Reviewed Solid Proposals
Candidate proposals to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, or Supporting Documentation submitted for review go through an editorial process before they are accepted. You can read more about the details of the submission and review process of proposals [here](https://github.com/solid/culture#how-to-make-changes). This week the roles are still being reviewed so the editorial process is on hold.
