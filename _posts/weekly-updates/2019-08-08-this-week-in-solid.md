# 8th August 2019

Hello and welcome to another issue of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) is a specification for building apps with separate data storage. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/solid/roadmap/blob/master/what-is-solid.md) with proposals. 

This is a weekly summary of its progress and community. 

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org or [send a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/solid/information#develop).

### Conversations on the Open Source Process 

You can read about [how the Solid open source process works](https://github.com/solid/process). There are several suggestions around how to adapt this process which you can [read and contribute to here](https://github.com/solid/process/pulls). 

There is a conversation about the prefered repository for specification proposals and what to do with other repositories to minimise confusion [here](https://github.com/solid/process/issues/100). 

### Panel Conversation to Generate Proposals 
Solid Panels are groups of individuals focused on a specific problem or domain relevant to Solid, with an aim to propose changes to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, and/or Supporting Documentation. Anyone may join a panel or suggest a new panel by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/solid/culture/blob/master/panels.md).

Here is an overview of active panel conversations this week. 

#### [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification)

On the [W3C Solid Community Group call on the 1st August](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Meetings#20190801_1600CEST) there was a conversation about which repository of Solid GitHub to identify as the normative specification where proposals in the form of pull requests should be submitted to? and what should be done with repositories that could be considered confusing to avoid confusion? In response an issue has been opened where you can [submit proposals on how to resolve it](https://github.com/solid/process/issues/100) and [vote](https://github.com/solid/process/issues/100) by putting a thumbs up or thumbs down on proposals you support or don't support.  | [Explaining the Vision Panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) |
