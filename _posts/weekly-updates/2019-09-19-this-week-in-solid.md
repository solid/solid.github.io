# 19th September 2019

Hello and welcome to another edition of *This Week in Solid*!

[Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on describing [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel).

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org or [send a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/solid/information#develop).

This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](./next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Solid Implementation
This week there are no updates or new [apps](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps), [Pods](https://github.com/solid/pods), or [identity providers](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list). 

## Solid Development
The Solid standard is currently referred to as [the specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) and is being led by the [editors](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones). The focus at the moment is to define the scope of a Solid spec deliverable for December by [submitting issues to the specifciation repository](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues). On the 27th December the editors will finalise the decision on which issues to include in the December deliverable scope by organising them into a defined [milestone](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones). 

## Updates on Solid Projects
