If you're here, it means that there are portions of your application that are covered by no existing vocabulary. If this is the case, you'll need to __build your own vocabulary__. Before getting started, let us remind you that the more existing vocabularies you reuse, the more reusable data from your app will re reusable by others. Therefore, a good thing to keep in mind is that your vocabulary should really be focused on a specific domain that you want to be able to describe, and for which nothing else exists.

To make things more hands-on, we'll see how [Cleopatra](https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/card#me) and [Caesar](https://jcaesar.solid.community/profile/card#me) build an overly simplified obelisk vocabulary as a toy example.

1. If you are in a hurry:
- [Quickstart creation](3-1-quickstart-creation): Build a vocabulary in 10 minutes
- [Quickstart usage](3-2-quickstart-usage): Use this vocabulary to describe some data

2. If you have some more time
- Before implementing your vocabulary, you might consider browsing these [best practices for building vocabularies](3-3-building-best-practices)
- For a more advanced tutorial, there exist [methodologies for building vocabularies](3-4-advanced-methodology)

Once you have your vocabulary RDF and documentation, the next step is [publishing it all](4-publish)
