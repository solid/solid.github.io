At this step of the tutorial, you should have:
- A vocabulary expressed in RDF, potentially in multiple syntaxes (Turtle, JSON-LD, N3, RDF/XML...)
- A documentation for this vocabulary in HTML

If you don't, then you should go back to the [vocabulary building tutorial](3-build). If you do, let's go live!
