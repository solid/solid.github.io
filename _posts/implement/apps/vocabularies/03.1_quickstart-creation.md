Let us build a very simple vocabulary describing [obelisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk), so that [Cleopatra](https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/card#me) and [Caesar](https://jcaesar.solid.community/profile/card#me) can share information about their personal collections.

## From plain English to a graphical representation

Let's start by stating in English what we'd like to put in our vocabulary:
- An <u>__obelisk__</u> is <u>__owned by__</u> a <u>__person__</u>.
- An <u>__obelisk__</u> is <u>__built by__</u> a <u>__sculptor__</u>.
- An <u>__obelisk__</u> has a <u>__height__</u>, which is a numerical value.

The underlined elements of these sentences are going to be the 'terms' in our vocabulary. We can identify two types of terms: the things that we talk about (e.g. <u>__obelisk__</u> or <u>__sculptor__</u>), and their properties (e.g. <u>__built by__</u> or <u>__height__</u>). Let's make a graphical representation of that, by putting the things in bubbles and the properties in squares:

![The obelisk vocabulary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tutorials/vocabularies/obelisk_vocab_1.png)

## From the representation to RDF

### Identifying things with IRI

RDF is the language that is used to build vocabularies for Linked Data. In RDF, everything is identified by an IRI. First, we'll need an IRI for our vocabulary, e.g. http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/. From there, let's update our plain English example a little bit:
- An <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk</u> is <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/ownedBy</u> a <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person</u>.
- An <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk</u> is <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/builtBy</u> a <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor</u>.
- An <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk</u> has a <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/height</u>, which is a numerical value.

Identifiers quickly become unpleasant to read when they are IRIs, so RDF introduces the notion of prefixes: from now on, `obelisk:` will stand for `http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/`, which means our vocabulary now looks like:
- An [obelisk:Obelisk](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) is [obelisk:ownedBy](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/ownedBy) a [obelisk:Person](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person).
- An [obelisk:Obelisk](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) is [obelisk:builtBy](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/builtBy) a [obelisk:Sculptor](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor).
- An [obelisk:Obelisk](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) has a [obelisk:height](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/height), which is a numerical value.

### Defining classes of things

In RDF, the general things that we can talk about are called __Classes__. Everything that went in a bubble in our first schema is therefore a Class, so we could add the following to our vocabulary:
- [obelisk:Obelisk](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) is a Class.
- [obelisk:Person](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person) is a Class.
- [obelisk:Sculptor](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor) is a Class.

If we look at these sentences, they are structured exactly like the ones from the rest of our vocabulary. Let us underline the important bits in the same way:
- [obelisk:Obelisk](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) [is a](???) [class](???).
- [obelisk:Person](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person) [is a](???) [class](???).
- [obelisk:Sculptor](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor) [is a](???) [class](???).

What we need now are IRI for the "[is a](???)" property and the "[Class](???)" Class. Fortunately, these are defined in the RDF and RDFS vocabularies: "[is a](???)" is defined by [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type), and "[class](???)" by [rdfs:Class](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class). Therefore, we could write:

```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .
```

And congratulations, you've just created your first snippet of RDF! This particular RDF syntax is called Turtle. Others exist but we don't need to go over them in this tutorial.

### Defining properties

The properties of things in RDF are called properties (how convenient). Therefore, following what we did for Classes, we might write:
- [obelisk:ownedBy](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/ownedBy) [is a](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [property](???).
- [obelisk:builtBy](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/builtBy) [is a](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [property](???).
- [obelisk:height](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/height) [is a](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [property](???).

We already know that [is a](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) is identified by the IRI [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type), so we can now go ahead and change that into:
- [obelisk:ownedBy](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/ownedBy) [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [property](???).
- [obelisk:builtBy](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/builtBy) [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [property](???).
- [obelisk:height](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/height) [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [property](???).

However, as we can see on the graphical representation we made earlier, there are two kind of properties: the ones connecting things (i.e. bubbles) together, and the ones attaching a 'value' to a thing. These are actually two different Classes of properties: the former are called [owl:ObjectProperty](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#ObjectProperty), and the latter [owl:DataProperty](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#DataProperty).

Which leads to our vocabulary looking like this:

```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty .
```

However, we can see in this current vocabulary that some information is still missing from our initial schema: nowhere does it say that [`obelisk:ownedBy`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/ownedBy) has something to do with [`obelisk:Obelisk`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) and [`obelisk:Person`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person) for instance. To do that, we need to introduce the notion of [rdfs:domain](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain) and [rdfs:range](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range). Basically, these two specify the class of the things connected by a property: the [rdfs:domain](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain) it the class of the thing the property is about, and the [rdfs:range](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range) is the class of the thing that the property points to. Therefore, we can add to our vocabulary:
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
# We connect here obelisk:ownedBy, obelisk:Obelisk and obelisk:Person
obelisk:ownedBy rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk .
obelisk:ownedBy rdfs:range obelisk:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:builtBy rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk .
obelisk:builtBy rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty .
obelisk:height rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk .
obelisk:height rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

Here, we could point out that things are getting pretty verbose. Thankfully the Turtle syntax provides shortcuts to avoid repeating the thing that we talk about when adding multiple properties to it (e.g. `obelisk:ownedBy` in the next snippet):
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    # We removed the repetitions of obelisk:ownedBy, and replaced the end of line by ; instead of .
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    # here too
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    # and there as well
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

### Connecting to other vocabularies

Terms in vocabularies are identified by IRI, and it's not for decoration: it means that you can use the identifiers across the entire Web. The cool thing about that is that it makes it really easy to reuse terms from remote vocabularies in your own vocabularies. For instance, [`obelisk:Obelisk`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk) is quite a specific term, so it makes perfect sense to define it ourselves. What about [`obelisk:Person`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person) ? Maybe there is a reference vocabulary out there that defines the concept of person... And if you pay a quick visit to [our list of well-known vocabularies](1-well-known), you will see that indeed there is! For instance, [Friend of a Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) (foaf for short) defines the term [foaf:Person](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person), and it would make our vocabulary easier to integrate into any application if we just reused this term instead of defining our own. Therefore, our vocabulary could look more something like this:

```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    # Now using the foaf:Person class
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

Moreover, sculptors are people too! Therefore the class we define, and that is specific to our vocabulary, is a specialization of a class defined elsewhere. Saying so is actually very easy, with the [rdfs:subClassOf](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf) property:
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
    # We say that a obelisk:Sculptor is a specific type of foaf:Person
    rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person.

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

## Adding human readability

### Using labels and comments

So far, all we have manipulated here are identifiers that are primarily made for machines. Although it is certainly not recommended, the IRIs themselves do not need to be meaningful to humans at all. For example, the following would technically be an equivalent vocabulary:
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:C001 rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:C002 rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
    # We say that a obelisk:Sculptor is a specific type of foaf:Person
    rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person.

obelisk:p001 rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:C001 ;
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:p002 rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:C001 ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:C002 .

obelisk:p003 rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:C001 ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```
Even if we don't want our vocabulary to look like this, the point we're making here is that we now need to add to our terms descriptions for humans. To do so we'll use the properties [`rdfs:label`](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#) to add a human-readable label for the term identified by the IRI, and [`rdfs:comment`](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment) to add a few sentences describing what is meant by the term in the context we use it. This could lead to something like this:
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
    # A label for readability...
    rdfs:label "Obelisk";
    # ... and a comment for understandability
    rdfs:comment "An obelisk is a four-sided pillar with a pyramid-shaped top.".

obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label rdfs:label "Sculptor" ;
    rdfs:comment "An artist who sculpts obelisks." ;
    rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "owned by" ;
    rdfs:comment "Relationship between an obelisk and the person who owns it, which is typically the person who ordered it, or to whom it was offered."
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "built by" ;
    rdfs:comment "Relationship between an obelisk and the person who built it." ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:label "heigth" ;
    # Note that so far we didn't specify the unit for the height. It can be hinted in the comment.
    rdfs:comment "The distance from the ground to the highest point of the obelisk, in meters." ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

### Adding multilingual support

So far all our labels and comments are written in English, yet there is no explicit indication of that in the vocabulary. To do so, RDF uses the concept of __language tag__: after a string, you can add a tag (e.g. @en for English, or @es for Spanish) to stipulate its language.

```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:Obelisk a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Obelisk"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "An obelisk is a four-sided pilar with a pyramid-shaped top."@en .

obelisk:Sculptor a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Sculptor"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "An artist who sculpts obelisks."@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .

obelisk:ownedBy a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "owned by"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Relationship between an obelisk and the person who owns it, which is typically the person who ordered it, or to whom it was offered."@en ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:builtBy a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "built by"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Relationship between an obelisk and the person who built it."@en ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:heigth a owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:label "heigth"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "The distance from the ground to the highest point of the obelisk, in meters."@en ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float.
```

And why stop there? [Cleopatra](https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/card#me) and [Caesar](https://jcaesar.solid.community/profile/card#me) want their vocabulary to be reused throughout the entire Roman empire, so they decide to also provide Italian translations for their labels and comments.

    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float.
```

## Adding some metadata

The finishing touch to this vocabulary is to add some metadata, so that people who find it will have a global description before going through its details. We already decided that the IRI of the vocabulary would be `http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/`, so this is the identifier we are going to use in RDF to say stuff about the vocabulary. In Linked Data terminology a vocabulary is called an [`owl:Ontology`](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Ontology), so the first thing to say is:
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

# `obelisk:` is equivalent to http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/
obelisk: rdf:type owl:Ontology .

# The remainder of the vocabulary is unchanged
obelisk:Obelisk a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Obelisk"@en ;
    rdfs:label "Obelisco"@it ;
    rdfs:comment "An obelisk is a four-sided pilar with a pyramid-shaped top."@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Un obelisco è un pilastro a quattro lati con una cima a forma di piramide."@it .
# ...
```

### Adding some description

Much like we described each term with human-friendly labels and comments, we can add a title ([`dcterms:title`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/title)) and a description ([`dcterms:description`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/description)) to our vocabulary. To make it easier to reuse, we can also indicate a preferred prefix ([`vann:preferredNamespacePrefix`](http://purl.org/vocab/vann/preferredNamespacePrefix)) and a preferred IRI ([`vann:preferredNamespaceURI`](http://purl.org/vocab/vann/preferredNamespaceURI)) (since multiple IRIs may point to the same vocabulary).
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

obelisk: rdf:type owl:Ontology ;
    dcterms:title "Obelisk ontology" ;
    # The description can be a multi-line text
    dcterms:description """
    The obelisk ontology aims at describing obelisks.
    """ ;
    vann:preferredNamespacePrefix "obelisk" ;
    vann:preferredNamespaceURI <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .

# The remainder of the vocabulary is unchanged
obelisk:Obelisk a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Obelisk"@en ;
    rdfs:label "Obelisco"@it ;
    rdfs:comment "An obelisk is a four-sided pilar with a pyramid-shaped top."@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Un obelisco è un pilastro a quattro lati con una cima a forma di piramide."@it .
# ...
```

### Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s

It is good practice to give ownership information about the vocabulary:
- who created it ([`dcterms:creator`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator)),
- who contributed to it ([`dcterms:contributor`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor)),
- who publishes it ([`dcterms:publisher`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher)),
- under what license it is distributed ([`dcterms:license`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/license))

### Versioning the vocabulary

A vocabulary may change over time, and so it is helpful to also provide some explicit version information. Details about versioning a vocabulary are given later in the [vocabulary publication tutorial](4.1-publish-rdf#iri), but we can add some basic information here, e.g.:
- a version number ([`owl:versionInfo`](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo))
- an initial publication date ([`dcterms:issued`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued))
- a version release date ([`dcterms:modified`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified))

This last modification yields a vocabulary in good shape to be used to describe our data:
